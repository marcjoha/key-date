# key-date

A tiny Chrome extension with one job only: insert the current date when a keyboard combination is pressed (defaults to CTRL+SHIFT+X).

##Installation

The extension is available through the Chrome Web Store at https://goo.gl/v2lMrT. Alternatively, you can clone/download the sources and add it using _Load unpacked extension..._ in [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).

##Credits

The icon is from the beautiful [Cirlce Icons](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1055101/calendar_date_event_icon) set. Thanks Nick Roach!
